# GascrestWaveTrap

## Overview:

GascrestWaveTrap is a finely tuned sentinel contract crafted to vigilantly monitor the ebb and flow of Ethereum’s block gas limit. By detecting subtle shifts of 1% or more between successive blocks, this trap serves as an early warning system, capturing the dynamic rhythm of network capacity changes.

## Core Mechanics:

Precision Monitoring: The trap’s collect() method captures the current block.gaslimit snapshot every block, feeding raw data into the detection pipeline.

Adaptive Thresholding: In shouldRespond(), it quantifies the relative change in gas limit with a sharp 1% sensitivity, primed to catch even minor “waves” in network gas availability.

Frequent Alerts: Designed to trigger often, GascrestWaveTrap empowers Drosera to react rapidly to subtle environmental shifts, enabling agile and proactive risk mitigation strategies.

Clear Signaling: Upon detection, it emits a clear, encoded message flagging the “Gaslimit crest,” ensuring handlers and downstream systems can swiftly interpret and act.

Seamless Handler Integration: Tailored to pair effortlessly with GascrestWaveRelay, which transforms encoded signals into readable events for observers and automation tools.

## Practical Impact:

Ideal for protocols and monitoring systems that need real-time insight into Ethereum’s gas limit dynamics—whether to anticipate congestion, adjust transaction strategies, or trigger automated defenses. GascrestWaveTrap provides a continuous pulse check on the network’s breathing space, helping maintain operational resilience.
